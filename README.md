These are the slides for the short "Slow Maps" talk held at the [Trondheim Big Data](http://www.meetup.com/Trondheim-Big-Data/) meeting during september 2014.

These are based on the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases) presentation framework, and are heavily inspired by @springmeyer's "Slow Maps" slides from 2011.

To see the slides, download everything (or clone the repo) and open up index.html in any decent web browser.
